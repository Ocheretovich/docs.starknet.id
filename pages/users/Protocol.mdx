When a user registers a stark name with Starknet.ID, this information is accessible across different all the Starknet Ecosystem. This means that every app will share the Starknet ID info and could use/display it instead of asking users to create their profile again.

## What is the difference between an identity and a domain ?

An identity is an NFT that everyone can mint for free. It represents your Starknet passport or profile. You'll be able to link your profile data to this identity, for example you can link a .stark domain to the identity you just minted. If you do then you'll have an identity linked with a domain and it'll be usable in our [ecosystem apps](/ecosystem/integrations).
