**Crypto commissions**

As an affiliate, you can promote domains and earn crypto commissions, in ETH or STRK, for every domain sale generated through your unique affiliate link.

- 25% commission on each direct referral
- Up to 50% on indirect referrals

**Passive income for Subscription**

If the user you referred subscribed for domain renewals you'll be able to earn this passive income each year.

**Withdraw rewards at any time**

Rewards are on-chain and distributed to a pool, affiliates can withdraw their earnings at any time. Because everything is tied to your address, you have the control and visibility to monitor it all!

**Here's how it works**

We are using a recursive chain. By referring someone, and them referring others, you earn commissions. This chain continues till infinity.

- Get 25% for a direct referral (A1)
- A1 refers A2 where A1 gets 25% and you get a portion of Starknet IDs share, caped by 50%.
