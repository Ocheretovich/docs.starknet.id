# Subscription

The Subscription feature ensures a hassle-free domain renewal process for users on the Starknet network. By leveraging an immutable smart contract, users can rest assured that their domains will be renewed seamlessly, without the burden of handling transaction costs.

## Overview

Upon enabling automatic renewal, StarknetID promises the following:

- **No hidden fees**: You are only charged for the domain renewal. Transaction fees are taken care of by StarknetID.
- **Full control**: You can deactivate this feature anytime you wish.
- **Maximum security**: The smart contract governing the process is immutable, which means it can't be altered, ensuring utmost reliability and security.

Here's how it works:

- Users authorize the smart contract to spend their funds for domain renewal.
- A StarknetID-controlled bot interacts with this contract, using user funds to renew domains.
- StarknetID bears the transaction costs on the blockchain.

## Audits

The Subscription smart-contracts have been audited by independent third-party security firms to ensure user security. You can take a look on audits [Audits](https://github.com/starknet-id/auto_renew_contract/tree/main/audits)
