At the core of Starknet.ID is the identity NFT. The platform provides a secure way for users to store and share their data within the Starknet ecosystem whichh simplifies data interactions across different protocols.

Stark domains provide a user friendly way to share their identity data. This is provided by the Stark Naming System which guarantees unique and user-friendly domain registrations, making sure that a domain is unmistakably tied to its owner.

A feature of Starknet.ID is its automatic renewal system. Users donâ€™t need to remember domain expiry dates; Starknet.ID takes care of renewing domains automatically. This ensures domains remain active without any manual intervention.
